/**
 * Plays one synthetic pointer stroke into a widget, so the widget's event
 * filters (Krita's KisInputManager on the canvas) see it like device input.
 * The events are marked spontaneous and delivered through
 * QCoreApplication::notify(), as QTest does: tools cancel a shape on a
 * non-spontaneous release, and sendEvent() clears the flag in Qt 6.
 *
 * Every stroke starts with an Enter at the first point, as when a real
 * pointer reaches the canvas: KisShortcutMatcher suppresses all actions
 * after a Leave, which the canvas gets when another window covers the
 * pointer.
 * With modifiers, ShortcutOverride and KeyPress events for Ctrl, Shift, Alt
 * and Meta follow the Enter, every pointer event carries the modifiers, and
 * KeyRelease events end the stroke. KisInputManager keeps such modifiers only
 * while the canvas has keyboard focus; otherwise it reads the real keyboard.
 * Mouse: a move without buttons to the first point, then, HoverSettleMs
 * later, press, moves, and ReleaseSettleMs after the last move the release
 * (for a double click: press, release, double click, release). The move is what a real mouse does before it presses;
 * tools such as the polygon selection close their shape only when the
 * pointer hovered over the first point before the click.
 * Tablet: TabletEnterProximity (to the application), one hover TabletMove at
 * the first point, TabletPress after HoverSettleMs, a system-synthesized
 * mouse press, TabletMoves, TabletRelease and TabletLeaveProximity. The hover
 * move lets KoToolProxy switch the canvas to the stylus before the press, as
 * a real pen's approach does; the first stylus event on a canvas creates new
 * tool instances, which ends a stroke that has already started. The
 * synthesized press stands for the one Windows generates after a pen press:
 * KisInputManager eats exactly one mouse press after each TabletPress
 * (EventEater::peckish), and without it the next real mouse stroke would lose
 * its press. Leaving proximity restores mouse input.
 *
 * In real-time mode each point is sent at its time offset; otherwise the
 * events are sent from consecutive event-loop iterations. Positions are in
 * the widget's coordinates. Only one stroke plays at a time.
