/**
 * GPU engine phase 2: composites a run of layers onto a projection device on
 * the GPU (docs/agent/gpu-engine.md).
 *
 * The projection's tiles are composited in place on the GPU (phase 3): they
 * become GPU-valid and CPU-stale, and CPU readers download them on demand.
 * Layers are read through their GPU-resident tiles (KisGpuTileAccess,
 * uploaded only when stale). Only pixels inside the rect change.
 *
 * Requires that no other thread writes the same projection tiles meanwhile:
 * KisUpdaterContext does not run merge jobs that share a tile while the GPU
 * projection is enabled.
 *
 * Thread-safe: concurrent calls use separate work contexts.
